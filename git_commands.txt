List of git commands:

1. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. git clone: Creates a copy of a remote repository on our local machine.

3. git add . or git add <file>: Stages changes for the next commit. We can specify specific files or use "." to stage all changes.

4. git commit -m "msg": Records the changes made to the repository by creating a new commit. It usually includes a message describing the changes.

5. git status: Displays the state of the working directory and staging area, showing which changes have been staged, which are not, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

6. git log: Shows the commit history for the repository, providing details about each commit made.

7. git branch: Lists all branches in the repository or creates a new branch based on the current branch.

8. git checkout: Switches between branches or restores working directory files.

9. git merge: Integrates changes from one branch into another, combining the histories.

10. git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

11. git push origin main: Sends commits from the local repository to a remote repository.

12. git stash: Temporarily saves changes that are not yet ready to be committed, allowing for a clean working directory.

13. git remote: Manages remote repository connections (add, remove, or view remotes).

14. git fetch: Retrieves changes from a remote repository without merging them into the current branch.

15. git reset: Reverts the working directory and staging area to a previous commit, optionally allowing for uncommitted changes to be kept.
